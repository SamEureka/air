<p class="front-intro">Hello! My name is Sam Dennon and I am the Director,
  Enterprise Application Services Division at Navy Cyber Defense Operations
  Command. I am responsible for leading Cyber Situational Awareness and
  Computer Network Defense Data Visualization projects in support of the
  U.S. Navy's Computer Network Defense Service Provider mission. My primary
  focus is building innovative data presentation applications, delivering critical
  network intrusion sensor information to analysts and decision makers.
  I have over 14 years federal government service in the Information Technology
  Security and Computer Network Defense fields.</p>

<p class="front-intro">Ok, TL,DR... I lead a team of amazing developers and
  we build JavaScript applications! I personally lean towards the Frontend of
  development, but I'm comfortable in a */nix terminal shell as well.
